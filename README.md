# Aquabox
The central part of Aquapilot systems. Based on a Rapsberry PI and Pi4j.
for more informations please visit : [aquapilot.org]

## Status
The project is actively developped but no stable releases are available for now.

## Contribute
Aquabox is developped in JAVA language and using TDD practices (Test driven development) with code quality in mind.

If you plan to do a PR you are of course welcome but please considere the following points:

* Unit Test: Aquabox manages fishes life so we have to assume this responsability.
* Test coverage: minimum 100% ! If your code cannot be tested it simply means you didn't do TDD. Rethink it and then
you can test it.
* Code has to be documented with Javadoc at least

Note: I know some of you will say "haha this guy is crazy 100% of testing !" but we deal with life of some animals and
we can't take any risks just because we are too lazy to test our stuff correctly. (And yes... it means hard job)
